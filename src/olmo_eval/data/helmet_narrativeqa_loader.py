"""HELMET NarrativeQA (LongQA) data loading.

Ports HELMET's `load_narrativeqa` (https://github.com/princeton-nlp/HELMET,
data.py): a novel or movie script plus a question about it, graded by an LLM
judge rather than string overlap.

HELMET keeps only documents longer than 131072 reference tokens, so every
instance is a genuinely long document truncated down to the target length --
never a short one padded up. Establishing that requires tokenizing candidate
documents, which is the expensive part of loading this task; see
`_iter_long_documents` for how that cost is bounded.

    Two shortcuts keep this from tokenizing the whole 10.5k-row test split,

    - A document can't have more tokens than characters, so anything shorter
      than the threshold in characters is rejected without tokenizing. This is
      an exact bound, not a heuristic.
    - NarrativeQA asks many questions about each document, so token counts are
      memoized per document.
