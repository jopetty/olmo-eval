"""HELMET Multi-LexSum (summarization) data loading.

Ports HELMET's `load_multi_lexsum` (https://github.com/princeton-nlp/HELMET,
data.py): the filings from a civil rights lawsuit, summarized in a paragraph
and graded by an LLM judge.

Reads the data from `allenai/helmet-plus` rather than calling
`load_dataset("allenai/multi_lexsum")`, which no longer works: `datasets` 4.0
dropped script-based loading and the Hub's parquet conversion has no
`v20230518` config. The hosted `multi_lexsum_val.jsonl` is the full validation
split -- sources, both summary lengths, and the pre-extracted key points the
judge needs -- so nothing is lost by bypassing the broken path, and pinning the
data makes runs reproducible besides.

            reference tokenizer. HELMET reserves more of the tier here than for
            LongQA (300 tokens rather than 200), so this is computed by the
            caller from the task config.
        shots: Number of example summaries to prepend. They carry no source
            documents, so they cost little against the budget.
        max_samples: Cap on the number of instances.
        seed: Seed for instance sampling and demo selection.
