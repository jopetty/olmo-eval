"""HELMET InfiniteBench data loading (LongQA and summarization).

Ports HELMET's `load_infbench` (https://github.com/princeton-nlp/HELMET,
data.py): a book-length story, with either a question about it (`qa_eng`,
`choice_eng`) or a request to summarize it (`sum_eng`). Unlike the recall
tasks, length here comes from truncating a real document, so these tasks stop
at standard HELMET's 128k -- the books themselves set the ceiling.

`sum_eng` is graded by an LLM judge against key points extracted ahead of time,
which ship separately from the dataset and are attached here. Its few-shot
demos embed complete gold summaries (upstream does the same), costing more than
the 200-token prompt reserve HELMET budgets, so the rendered prompt runs a few
percent over nominal at the shortest tiers (~8.4k at the 8k tier) and
proportionally less above.

Contexts are truncated with a *fixed reference tokenizer* (Llama 2, as
upstream) rather than the tokenizer of whichever model is being evaluated.
That is deliberate and load-bearing: it is what makes every model see exactly
the same text, and it keeps our numbers comparable to published HELMET
results. It does mean the realized length under Olmo 3 differs from nominal,
the same trade already taken for the ICL tasks -- see `helmet_tasks.py`.
